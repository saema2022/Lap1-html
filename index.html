   <p> Well I would start introducing myself with my name. My name is Saema and I live in U.S, I was born in Bangladesh.We joined schools here and made lots of friends.At school, at first it was difficult for us to get along as the systems were entirely different and the language was also a bit tough. Then we gradually picked up and got along fine. We participated in all the activities of the school and enjoyed our school days.I have a wish when I'll finish my studies I want to be software engineering.
